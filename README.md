# Lexer README

The Lexer is a component of the software designed for lexical analysis of source code. It scans the input source code character by character and generates tokens representing various language constructs. These tokens are then used by subsequent components for parsing and analysis.

## Overview

The Lexer package consists of several classes responsible for different aspects of lexical analysis:

- `Lexer`: This class is the core component of the lexer. It scans the input source code and generates tokens based on predefined rules.

- `Token`: Represents a lexical token generated by the lexer. Each token has a type and, optionally, a value associated with it.

- `LexerOut`: Represents the output of the lexer, which includes a list of tokens and, optionally, an error if encountered during the lexical analysis process.

- `Constants`: Defines constant values used by the lexer, such as character sets, data types, keywords, operators, and symbols.

- `Function`: Contains utility functions used by the lexer, such as character checking, string manipulation, and shell interaction.

- `Tuple`, `TupleKeyValue`, `TupleKeyValueValue`: Classes for creating tuples and key-value pairs used internally by the lexer.

- `Node`: Represents a node in the abstract syntax tree (AST) and contains information about its position in the source code.

- `Position`: Represents a position in the source code, including the character index, line number, column number, and the associated text.
